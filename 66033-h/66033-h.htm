<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>A flashlight battery supplies electricity without moving
mechanical parts. It converts the chemical energy of its
contents <i>directly</i> into electrical energy.</p>
<p>Early direct conversion devices such as Volta&rsquo;s battery,
developed in 1795, gave the scientists Ampere, Oersted,
and Faraday their first experimental supplies of electricity.
The lessons they learned about electrical energy and its
intimate relation with magnetism spawned the mighty
turboelectric energy converters&mdash;steam and hydroelectric
turbines&mdash;which power modern civilization.</p>
<p>We have improved upon Volta&rsquo;s batteries and have come
to rely on them as portable, usually small, power sources,
but only recently has the challenge of nuclear power and
space exploration focused our attention on new methods of
direct conversion.</p>
<p>To supply power for use in outer space and also at remote
sites on earth, we need power sources that are reliable,
light in weight, and capable of unattended Operation for long
periods of time. Nuclear power plants using direct conversion
techniques hold promise of surpassing conventional
power sources in these attributes. In addition, the inherently
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
silent operation of direct conversion power plants is
an important advantage for many military applications.</p>
<p>The Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of Defense,
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
collectively sponsor tens of millions of dollars worth
of research and development in the area of direct conversion
each year. In particular, the Atomic Energy Commission
supports more than a dozen research and development
programs in thermoelectric and thermionic energy conversion
in industry and at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory,
and other direct conversion research at Argonne National
Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Reactor and radioisotopic power plants utilizing direct conversion
are being produced under the AEC&rsquo;s SNAP<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> program.
Some of these units are presently in use powering
satellites, Arctic and Antarctic weather stations, and navigational
buoys.</p>
<p>Further applications are now being studied, but the cost
of direct conversion appears too great to permit its general
use for electric power in the near future. Direct techniques
will be used first where their special advantages outweigh
higher cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">DIRECT VERSUS DYNAMIC ENERGY CONVERSION</span></h2>
<h3>Dominance of Dynamic Conversion</h3>
<p>We live in a world of motion. A main task of the engineer
is to find better and more efficient ways of transforming
the energy locked in the sun&rsquo;s rays or in fuels, such as coal
and the uranium nucleus, into energy of motion. Almost all
the world&rsquo;s energy is now transformed by rotating or reciprocating
machines. We couple the energy of exploding
gasoline and air to our automobile&rsquo;s wheels by a reciprocating
engine. The turbogenerator at a hydroelectric plant
extracts energy from falling water and turns it into electricity.
Such rotating or reciprocating machines are called
<i>dynamic</i> converters.</p>
<h3>A New Level of Sophistication: Direct Conversion</h3>
<p>A revolution is in the making. We know now that we can
force the heat-and-electricity-carrying electrons residing
in matter to do our bidding without the use of shafts and
pistons. This is a leading accomplishment of modern technology:
energy transformation without moving parts. It is
called <i>direct</i> conversion.</p>
<p>The thermoelements shown above the turbogenerator in
<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> illustrate the contrast between direct and dynamic
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
conversion. The thermoelements convert heat into electricity
directly, without any of the intervening machinery
seen in the turbogenerator.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">

shown below SNAP 3 (courtesy Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc.) includes
a high-speed turbine, an electric generator, and pumps to produce
electricity from heat. (NaK is a liquid mixture of sodium and
potassium.)</i></p>

<h3>Why is Direct Conversion Desirable?</h3>
<p>There are places where energy conversion equipment
must run for years without maintenance or breakdown.
Also, there are situations where the ultimate in reliability
is required, such as on scientific satellites and particularly
on manned space flights. Direct conversion equipment seems
to offer greater reliability than dynamic conversion equipment
for these purposes.</p>
<p>We should recognize that our belief in the superiority of
direct conversion is based more on intuition than proof. It
is true that direct converters will never throw piston rods
or run out of lubricant. Yet, some satellite power failures
have been caused by the degradation of solar cells under
the bombardment of solar protons. The other types of direct
conversion devices described in the following pages may
also break down in ways as yet unknown. Still, today&rsquo;s
knowledge gives us hope that direct conversion will be
more reliable and trustworthy than dynamic conversion.
Direct conversion equipment is beginning to be adopted for
small power plants, producing less than 500 watts, designed
to operate for long periods of time in outer space and under
the ocean. Some day, large central-station power plants
may use direct conversion to improve their efficiencies and
reliabilities.</p>
<h3>How is Energy Transformed?</h3>
<p>What is energy and how do we change it? Energy is a
fundamental concept of science involving the capacity for
doing work. <i>Kinetic</i> or mechanical energy is the most obvious
form of energy. It is defined as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">E = &frac12; mv&sup2;</p>
<p class="t0">where</p>
<p class="t">E = energy (expressed in joules)</p>
<p class="t">m = mass of the moving object (in kilograms)</p>
<p class="t">v = velocity (in meters per second)</p>
</div>
<p>Energy can also be stored in chemical and nuclear substances
or in the water behind a dam. In these quiescent
states it is called <i>potential</i> energy. If the potential energy
in a substance is abundant and easily released, the energy-rich
substance is called a <i>fuel</i>.</p>

<h3>The Energy Conversion Matrix</h3>
<p>Forms of energy are interchangeable. When gasoline is
burned in an automobile engine, potential energy is first
turned into heat. A portion of this heat, say 25%, is then
converted into mechanical motion. The remainder of the
heat is wasted and must be removed from the engine.</p>
<p>A multitude of processes and devices have been found
which make these transformations from one form of energy
to another. Many of these are listed in the blocks in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.
Asterisks refer to direct conversion processes, the subject
matter of this booklet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>To demonstrate how this diagram is to be read, let us
use it to trace the energy transformations involved in an
automobile engine. We begin with sunlight because all coal
and oil deposits (the <i>fossil fuels</i>) received their initial
charge of energy in the form of sunlight.</p>
<p>The first conversion, therefore, is from electromagnetic
energy to chemical energy via photosynthesis in living
things. We trace the transformation by moving down the
column marked Electromagnetic Energy until it intersects
the horizontal row labeled Chemical Energy. There we see
photosynthesis listed in the block. The next conversion is
from chemical energy to thermal energy via combustion.
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
We trace this by moving down the Chemical Energy column
to the Thermal Energy row; combustion is listed in the appropriate
block. The third and final conversion takes place
when thermal energy is transformed into mechanical energy
via the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>By the repeated use of the Energy Conversion Matrix in
this way, we can chart any energy transformation.</p>
<h4>Problem <span class="larger">1</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Continue the automobile example by going through
the matrix twice more showing how mechanical
energy is converted into stored chemical energy
in the car&rsquo;s battery.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Problem <span class="larger">2</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If 1 gram of gasoline (about a tablespoonful) yields
48,000 joules of thermal energy when burned with
air, how fast can it make a 1000 kilogram car go?
Assume the car starts from rest and its engine is
25% efficient.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">LAWS GOVERNING ENERGY CONVERSION</span></h2>
<h3>The Big Picture: Thermodynamics</h3>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, energy and mass are always
conserved together in any transformation. This summary
of experience has been made into a keystone of science:
the Law of Conservation of Energy and Mass. It
states that the total amount of mass and energy cannot be
altered. This law applies to everything we do, from driving
a nail to launching a space probe. While the conscience of
the scientist insists that he continually recheck the truth of
this law, it remains a bulwark of science.</p>
<p>The Law of Conservation of Energy and Mass is also
called the First Law of Thermodynamics. It is related to
the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which also governs energy
transformations. The Second Law says, in effect, that
some energy will unavoidably be lost in all heat engines.
The first two laws of thermodynamics have been paraphrased
as (1) You can&rsquo;t win; (2) You can&rsquo;t even break even.
Let us look at them further.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3>You Can&rsquo;t Win</h3>
<p>We used to think that energy and mass were conserved
independently, and for many practical purposes we still
consider them so conserved. But Einstein united the two
with the famous equation</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">E = mc&sup2;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">where</p>
<p class="t">E = energy (in joules)</p>
<p class="t">m = mass (in kilograms)</p>
<p class="t">c = speed of light</p>
<p class="t3">(300,000,000 meters per second)</p>
</div>
<p>Notice the resemblance to the kinetic energy equation shown
earlier. Energy cannot appear without the disappearance of
mass. When energy is locked up in a fuel, it is stored as
mass. In the gasoline combustion problem, 1 gram of gasoline
was burned with air to give 48,000 joules of energy.
Einstein&rsquo;s equation says that in this case mass disappeared
in the amount</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">m = E/c&sup2; = (4.8 &times; 10&#8308;)/(9 &times; 10&sup1;&#8310;) = 5.3 &times; 10&#8315;&sup1;&sup3; kilogram</p>
<p class="t2">(half a billionth of a gram)</p>
</div>
<p>But, when an H-bomb is exploded, grams and even kilograms
of mass are converted to energy.</p>
<p>In direct conversion processes we do not need to worry
about these mass changes, but at each point we must make
sure that all energy is accounted for. For example, in outer
space all energy released from fuels (even food) must ultimately
be radiated away to empty Space. Otherwise the vehicle
temperature will keep rising until the Spaceship melts.</p>
<h3>You Can&rsquo;t Even Break Even</h3>
<p>Any engineer is annoyed by having to throw energy away.
Why is energy ever wasted? The Second Law of Thermodynamics
guides us here. Experience has shown that heat cannot
be transformed into another form of energy with 100%
efficiency. We can&rsquo;t explain Nature&rsquo;s idiosyncracies, but we
have to live with them. So, we accept the fact that every engine
that starts out with heat must ultimately waste some of
that energy (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<p>Direct conversion devices are no exception. Consequently,
every thermoelectric element or thermionic converter will
have to provide for the disposition of waste heat. The designer
will try, however, to make the engine efficiency high
so that the waste heat will be small. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows the
extensive waste heat radiator on a SNAP 50 power plant
planned for deep space missions.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3>Carnot Efficiency</h3>
<p>In 1824 Sadi Carnot, a young French engineer, conceived
of an idealized heat engine. This ideal engine had an efficiency
given by</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">e = 1 - T<sub>c</sub>/T<sub>h</sub> = (T<sub>h</sub> - T<sub>c</sub>)/T<sub>h</sub></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">where</p>
<p class="t">e = the so-called Carnot efficiency (no units)</p>
<p class="t">T<sub>c</sub> = the temperature of the waste heat reservoir (in degrees Kelvin, &deg;K<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>)</p>
<p class="t">T<sub>h</sub> = the temperature of the heat source (in &deg;K)</p>
</div>
<p>Unhappily, T<sub>c</sub> cannot be made zero (and e therefore made
equal to 1, which is 100% efficiency). Physicists have shown
absolute zero to be unattainable, although they have approached
to within a hundredth of a degree in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Waste heat, since it must be rejected to the surrounding
atmosphere, outer space, or water (rivers, the ocean, etc.),
must be rejected at T<sub>c</sub> greater than 300&deg;K. The reason for
this is that these physical reservoirs have average temperatures
around 300&deg;K (about 80&deg;F) themselves. The fact
that T<sub>c</sub> must be 300&deg;K or more is a basic limitation on the
Carnot efficiency. The loss in efficiency with increased T<sub>c</sub>
explains why a jet plane has a harder job taking off on a hot
day.</p>
<p>One way to improve the Carnot efficiency, which is the
maximum efficiency for any heat engine, is to raise T<sub>h</sub> as
high as possible without melting the engine. For a coal-fired
electrical power plant, T<sub>h</sub> = 600&deg;K and T<sub>c</sub> = 300&deg;K, so
that</p>
<p class="center">e = 1 - 300/600 = 0.5 = 50%</p>
<p>The actual efficiency is somewhat less than this ideal
value because some power is diverted to pumps and other
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
equipment and to unavoidable heat losses. Later on, we
shall see that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators hold
prospects for increasing T<sub>h</sub> by hundreds of degrees.</p>
<p>Everything that has been said about the Second Law of
Thermodynamics (You can&rsquo;t even break even) applies to
heat engines, where we begin with thermal energy. Suppose
instead that we start with kinetic or chemical energy and
convert it into electricity without turning it into heat first.
We can then escape the Carnot efficiency strait jacket.
Chemical batteries perform this trick. So do fuel cells,
solar cells, and many other direct conversion devices we
shall discuss. Thus, we circumvent the Carnot efficiency
limitation by using processes to which it does not apply.</p>
<h4>Problem <span class="larger">3</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Some space power plants contemplate using the
space cabin heat (T<sub>h</sub> = 300&deg;K) to drive a heat engine
which rejects its waste heat to the liquid-hydrogen
rocket fuel stored at T<sub>c</sub> = 20&deg;K. What
would be the Carnot efficiency of this engine?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">THERMOELECTRICITY</span></h2>
<h3>After 140 Years: Seebeck Makes Good</h3>
<p>The oldest direct conversion heat engine is the thermocouple.
Take two different materials (typically, two dissimilar
metal wires), join them, and heat the junction. A
voltage, or electromotive force, can be measured across
the unheated terminals. T. J. Seebeck first noticed this effect
in 1821 in his laboratory in Berlin, but, because of a
mistaken interpretation of what was involved, he did not
seek any practical application for it. Only recently has any
real progress been made in using his discovery for power
production. To use the analogy of A. F. Joffe, the Russian
pioneer in this field, thermoelectricity lay undisturbed for
over a hundred years like Sleeping Beauty. The Prince that
awoke her was the semiconductor.</p>
<p>As long as inefficient metal wires were used, textbook
writers were correct in asserting that thermoelectricity
could never be used for power production. The secret of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
practical thermoelectricity is therefore the creation of
better thermoelectric materials. (Creation is the right word
since the best materials for the purpose do not exist in
nature.) To perform this alchemy, we first have to understand
the Seebeck effect.</p>
<h3>Electrons and Holes</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the latticework of atoms that make up any
solid material. In electrical insulators all the atoms&rsquo; outer
electrons<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> are held tightly by valence bonds to the neighboring
atoms. In contrast, any metal has many relatively
loose electrons which can wander freely through its latticework.
This is what makes metals good conductors.</p>

<p><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> suggests the latticework of a <i>semiconductor</i>. It
is called a semiconductor because its conductivity falls far
short of that of the metals. The few electrons available for
carrying electricity are supplied by the deliberately introduced
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
impurity atoms, which have more than enough electrons
to satisfy the valence-bond requirements of the neighboring
atoms. Without the impurities, we would have an
insulator. With them, we have an <i>n</i>-type semiconductor.
The <i>n</i> is for the extra <i>negative</i> electrons.</p>
<p>A <i>p</i>- or <i>positive</i>-type semiconductor is also included in
<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. Here the impurity atom does not have enough
valence electrons to satisfy the valence-bond needs of the
surrounding lattice atoms. The lattice has been short-changed
and is, in effect, full of <i>positive holes</i>. Strangely
enough, these holes can wander through the material just
like positive charges.</p>
<p>The electron-hole model does not have the precision the
physicist likes, but it helps us to visualize semiconductor
behavior.</p>
<p>The Seebeck effect is demonstrated when pieces of <i>p</i>- and
<i>n</i>-type material are joined as shown in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. Heat at
the hot junction drives the loose electrons and holes toward
the cold junction. Think of the holes and electrons as gases
being driven through the latticework by the temperature
difference. A positive and a negative terminal are thus produced,
giving us a source of power. The larger the temperature
difference, the bigger the voltage difference. Note
that just one thermocouple <i>leg</i> can produce a voltage across
its length, but <i>couples</i> made from <i>p</i> and <i>n</i> legs are superior.</p>
<h3>Practical Thermoelectric Power Generators</h3>
<p>The first nuclear-heated thermoelectric generator was
built in 1954 by the Atomic Energy Commission&rsquo;s Mound
Laboratory in Miamisburg, Ohio. It used metal-wire thermocouples.
In contrast, the SNAP 3 series thermocouples
shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> are thick lead telluride (PbTe) semiconductor
cylinders about two inches long. In contrast to the
thermocouple wires&rsquo; efficiency of less than 1%, SNAP 3
series generators have overall efficiencies exceeding 5%.
This value is still low compared to the 35-40% obtained in
a modern steam power plant, but SNAP 3 generators can
operate unattended in remote localities where steam plants
would be totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>Look again at the thermoelements in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and the
schematic, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. Underlying the apparent simplicity of
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the thermoelectric generator are extensive development efforts.
The <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> thermoelectric couple, for example,
shows the fruits of thousands of experimental brazing tests.
It turns out to be uncommonly difficult to fasten thermoelectric
elements to the so-called <i>hot shoe</i> (metal plate) at
the bottom. The joint has to be strong, must withstand high
temperatures, and must have low electrical resistance. We
see also that the elements are encased in mica sleeves to
prevent chemical disturbance of the delicate balance of impurities
in the semiconductor by the surrounding gases. A
further complication is the extreme fragility of the elements,
and this has yet to be overcome.</p>
<p>Nuclear thermoelectric generators that provide small
amounts of electrical power have already been launched into
space aboard Department of Defense satellites (<a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>),
installed on land stations in both polar regions, and placed
under the ocean.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> Propane-fueled thermoelectric generators,
such as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>, are now on the market for
use in camping equipment, in ocean buoys, and in remote
spots where only a few watts of electricity are needed. The
Russians have long manufactured a kerosene lamp with
thermoelements placed in its stack for generating power in
wilderness areas.</p>

</div>
<p>For the present the role of thermoelectric power appears
to be one of special uses such as those just mentioned.
When higher efficiencies are attained, thermoelectric power
may, one day, supplant dynamic conversion equipment in
certain low-power applications regardless of location.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">THERMIONIC CONVERSION</span></h2>
<h3>&ldquo;Boiling&rdquo; Electrons Out of Metals</h3>
<p>Like the thermoelectric element, the thermionic converter
is a heat engine. In its simplest form it consists of two
closely spaced metallic plates and resembles the diode radio
tube. Whereas thermoelectric elements depend on heat to
drive electrons and holes through semiconductors to an external
electricity-using device or <i>load</i>, the salient feature
of the thermionic diode is <i>thermionic
emission</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> or, simply,
the boiling-off of electrons from a hot metal surface.
The thermionic converter shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> powers a small
motor when heated by a torch.</p>
<p>Metals, as we have already seen, have
an abundance of loosely bound conduction
electrons roaming the atomic latticework.
These electrons are easily moved by
electric fields while within the metal; but
it takes considerably more energy to boil
them out of the metal into free space.
Work has to be done against the electric
fields set up by the surface layer of
atoms, which have unattached valence
bonds on the side facing empty space.</p>
<p>The energy required to completely detach
an electron from the surface is called
the metal&rsquo;s <i>work function</i>. In the case of
tungsten, for example, the work function
is about 4.5 electron volts<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> of energy.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 7</b> <i>Vacuum type thermionic
converter in operation.</i>
<span class="jr">Courtesy General Electric Company.</span></p>
</div>
<p>As we raise the temperature of a metal, the conduction
electrons in the metal also get hotter and move with greater
velocity. We may think of some of the electrons in a metal
as forming a kind of <i>electron gas</i>. Some electrons will gain
such high speeds that they can escape the metal surface.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
This happens when their kinetic energy exceeds the metal&rsquo;s
work function.</p>
<p>Now that we have found a way to force electrons out of
the metal, we would like to make them do useful electrical
work. To do this we have to push the electrons across the
gap between the plates as well as create a voltage difference
to go with the hoped-for current flow.</p>
<h3>Reducing the Space Charge</h3>
<p>The emitted or boiled-off electrons between the converter
plates (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>) form a cloud of negative charges that
will repel subsequently emitted electrons back to the emitter
plate unless counteraction is taken. To circumvent
these <i>space charge</i> effects, we fill the space between the
plates with a gas containing positively charged particles.
These mix with the electrons and neutralize their charge.
The mixture of positively and negatively charged particles
is called a <i>plasma</i>.</p>
<p>The presence of the plasma makes the gas a good conductor.
The emitted electrons can now move easily across
it to the collector where, to continue the gas analogy, they
condense on the cooler surface.</p>

<h3>Result: A Plasma Thermocouple</h3>
<p>Unless a voltage difference exists across the plates, no
external work can be done. In the thermocouple the voltage
difference was caused by the different electrical properties
of the <i>p</i> and <i>n</i> semiconductors. Both the emitter and collector
in the thermionic converter are good metallic conductors
rather than semiconductors, so a different tack must
be taken.</p>
<p>The key is the use of an emitter and a collector with different
work functions. If it takes 4.5 electron volts to force
an electron from a tungsten surface and if it regains only
3.5 electron volts when it condenses on a collector with a
lower work function, then a voltage drop of 1 volt exists between
the emitter and collector.</p>
<p>To summarize, then, the thermionic emission of electrons
creates the potentiality of current flow. The difference
in work functions makes the thermionic converter a
power producer.</p>
<p>There is an interesting comparison that helps describe
this phenomenon. Consider the emitter to be the ocean surface
and the collector a mountain lake. The atmospheric
heat engine vaporizes ocean water and carries it to the
cooler mountain elevations, where it condenses as rain
which collects in lakes. The lake water as it runs back
toward sea level then can be made to drive a hydroelectric
plant with the gravitational energy it has gained in the
transit. The thermionic converter is similar in behavior:
hot emitter (corresponding to the sun-heated ocean); cooler
collector (lake); electron gas (water); different electrical
voltages (gravity). Without gravity the river would not flow,
and the production of electricity would be impossible.</p>
<h3>Thermionic Power in Outer Space</h3>
<p>Thermionic converters for use in outer space may be
heated by the sun, by decaying radioisotopes, or by a fission
reactor. Thermionic converters can also be made into
concentric cylindrical shells (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>a) and wrapped
around the uranium fuel elements in nuclear reactors. The
waste heat in this case would be carried out of the reactor
to a separate radiator<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> by a stream of liquid metal. Since
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
thermionic converters can operate at much higher temperatures
than thermoelectric couples or dynamic power plants,
the radiator temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, will also be higher. Consequently,
space power plants using thermionic converters
will have small radiators. Once thermionic converters are
developed which have high reliability and long life, they will
provide the basis for a new series of lighter, more efficient
space power plants.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC CONVERSION</span></h2>
<h3>Big Word, Simple Concept</h3>
<p>Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) conversion is very unlike
thermoelectric or thermionic conversion. The MHD generators
use high-velocity electrically conducting gases to
produce power and are generically closer to dynamic conversion
concepts. The only concept they carry forward from
the preceding conversion ideas is that of the <i>plasma</i>, the
electrically conducting gas. Yet they are commonly classified
as <i>direct</i> because they replace the rotating turbogenerator
of the dynamic systems with a stationary pipe or
<i>duct</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="533" />
<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 9</b> <i>In the MHD duct (a), the electrons in the hot plasma move

<p>In the conventional dynamic generator, an electromotive
force is created in a wire that cuts through magnetic lines
of force, as shown in <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>b. It may be helpful to visualize
the conduction electrons as leaving one end of the wire
and moving to the other under the influence of the magnetic
field.</p>
<p>The force on the electrons in the wire is given by</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">F = qvB</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">where</p>
<p class="t">F = the force (in newtons<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>)</p>
<p class="t">q = the charge on the electron (1.6 &times; 10&#8315;&sup1;&#8313; coulomb)</p>
<p class="t">v = the wire&rsquo;s velocity (in meters per second)</p>
<p class="t">B = the magnetic field strength (in webers per square meter<a class="fn" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>The surge of electrons along the length of the wire sets
up a voltage difference across the ends of the wire. A generator
uses this difference to convert the kinetic energy of
the moving wire or armature into electrical energy. The
wire is kept spinning by the shaft which is connected to a
turbine driven by steam or water.</p>
<p>Let us try to eliminate the moving part, the generator
armature. What we need is a moving conductor that has no
shaft, no bearings, no wearing parts. The substance that
meets these requirements is the plasma. Examine <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>a.
The MHD generator substitutes a moving, conducting gas
for the wires. Under the influence of an external magnetic
field, the conduction electrons move through the plasma to
one side of the duct which carries electrical power away to
the load.</p>
<p>The MHD generator gets its energy from an expanding,
hot gas; but, unlike the turbogenerator, the heat engine and
generator are united in the static duct. The gradual widening
of the duct shown in <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>a reflects the lower pressure,
cooler plasma at the duct&rsquo;s end. Some of the plasma&rsquo;s
thermal energy content has been tapped off by the duct&rsquo;s
electrodes as electrical power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h3>The Fourth State of Matter</h3>
<p>Plasma can be created by temperatures over 2000&deg;K. At
this temperature many high-velocity gas atoms collide with
enough energy to knock electrons off each other and thus
become ionized. The material thus created, shown as a
glowing gas in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>, does not behave consistently as
any of the three familiar states of matter: solid, liquid, or
gas. Plasma has been called a <i>fourth state of matter</i>. Since
we have difficulty in containing such high temperatures on
earth, we adopt the strategy of <i>seeding</i>. In this technique
gases that are ordinarily difficult to ionize, like helium,
are made conducting by adding a fraction of a percent of an
alkali metal such as potassium. Alkali metal atoms have
loosely bound outer electrons and quickly become ionized
at temperatures well below 2000&deg;K.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

</div>
<p>A helium-potassium mixture is a good enough conductor
for use in an MHD generator. In this plasma the electrons
move rapidly under the influence of the applied fields,
though not as well as in metals. The positive ions move in
the opposite direction from the electrons, but the electrons
are much lighter and move thousands of times faster thus
carrying the bulk of the electrical current.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3>MHD Power Prospects</h3>
<p>The MHD duct is not a complete power plant in itself because,
after leaving the duct, the stream of gas must be
compressed, heated, and returned to the duct. Very high
temperature materials and components must be developed
for this kind of service. Moreover, while the duct is simple
in concept, it must operate at very high temperatures in the
presence of the corrosive alkali metals. This presents us
with difficult materials problems. When the problems are
solved, probably within the next decade, MHD power plants
should be able to provide reliable power with high efficiency.
They may then serve in large space power plants, and, most
important, they may provide cheaper electricity for general
use through their higher temperatures and greater efficiencies.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHEMICAL BATTERIES</span></h2>
<h3>Electricity from the Chemical Bond</h3>
<p>If you vigorously knead a lemon to free the juices and then
stick a strip of zinc in one end and a copper strip in the
other, you can measure a voltage across the strips. Electrons
will flow through the load without the inconvenience of
having to supply heat. You have made yourself a chemical
battery.</p>
<p>The chemical battery was the first direct conversion device.
Two hundred years ago it was the scientists&rsquo; only continuous
source of electricity.</p>
<p>Since the chemical battery does not need heat for its operation,
it is logical to ask what makes the current flow.
Where does the energy come from?</p>
<p>The battery has no semiconductors, but, like the thermoelectric
couple and the thermionic diode, it uses dissimilar
materials for its electrodes. A conducting fluid or solid is
also present to provide for the passage of current between
the electrodes. In the example of the lemon, the copper and
zinc are the dissimilar electrodes, and the lemon juice is
the conducting fluid or <i>electrolyte</i> that supplies positive and
negative ions. The battery derives its energy from its complement
of chemical fuel. The voltage difference arises
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
because of the different strengths of the chemical bonds.
The chemical bond is basically an electrostatic one; some
atoms have stronger electrical affinities than others.</p>
<h3>Chemical Reactions Used in Batteries and Fuel Cells</h3>
<p>Consider the following chemical reactions of common
batteries together with some fuel cell reactions which will
be discussed further in the next section.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><span class="ss">Battery Reactions</span></dt>
<dd>Pb + PbO&#8322; + 2H&#8322;SO&#8324; &hArr; 2PbSO&#8324; + 2H&#8322;O</dd>
<dd>Fe + NiO&#8322; &hArr; FeO + NiO</dd>
<dd>Zn + AgO + H&#8322;O &hArr; Ag + Zn(OH)&#8322;</dd>
<dd>Pb + Ag&#8322;O &hArr; PbO + 2Ag</dd>
<dt><span class="ss">Fuel Cell Reactions</span></dt>
<dd>2LiH &hArr; 2Li + H&#8322;</dd>
<dd>2CuBr&#8322; &hArr; 2CuBr + Br&#8322;</dd>
<dd>2H&#8322; + O&#8322; &hArr; 2H&#8322;O (Bacon cell)</dd>
<dd>PbI&#8322; &hArr; Pb + I&#8322;</dd></dl>
<p>In principle all these reactions are the same as those
going on inside the lemon, although each type of cell produces
a slightly different voltage because of the varying
chemical affinities of the atoms and molecules involved.
There are literally hundreds of materials which can be used
for electrolytes and electrodes.</p>
<p>No heat needs to be added as the electrostatic chemical
bonds are broken and remade in a battery to generate electrical
power. The chemical reaction energy is transferred
to the electrical load with almost 100% efficiency. The
Carnot cycle is no limitation here; only &ldquo;cold&rdquo; electrostatic
forces are in action. The reactions cannot go on forever,
however, because the battery supplies the energy converter
with a very limited supply of fuel. Eventually the
fuel is consumed and the voltage drops to zero. This deficiency
is remedied by the fuel cell in which fuel is supplied
continuously.</p>
<h3>An Old Standby in Outer Space</h3>
<p>Almost every satellite and space vehicle has a chemical
battery aboard. It is not there so much for continuous power
production but as a rechargeable electrical accumulator or
reservoir to provide electricity during peak loads. The battery
is also needed to store energy for use during the periods
when solar cells are in the earth&rsquo;s shadow and therefore
inoperative. In this capacity the dependable old battery
serves the most modern science very well indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">THE FUEL CELL: A CONTINUOUSLY FUELED BATTERY</span></h2>
<h3>Potential Fuels</h3>
<p>The battery has a very close relative, the fuel cell. Unlike
the battery the fuel cell has a continuous supply of fuel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="559" />
<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 11</b> <i>This diagram shows how a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell

<p>The hydrogen-oxygen cell of <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> is typical of all
fuel cells. It essentially burns hydrogen and oxygen to form
water. If the hydrogen and oxygen can be supplied continuously
and the excess water drained off, we can greatly extend
the life of the battery. The fuel cell accomplishes this.
Fueled <i>electrical</i> cell would be more descriptive since the
physical principles are identical with those of the battery.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most challenging task contemplated for the
fuel cell is to bring about the consumption of raw or slightly
processed coal, gas, and oil fuels with atmospheric oxygen.
If fuel cells can be made to use these abundant fuels, then
the high natural conversion efficiency of the fuel cells will
make them economically superior to the lower efficiency
steam-electric plants now in commercial service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>So far we have dwelt on the fuel cell as a cold energy conversion
device that is <i>not</i> limited by the Carnot efficiency.
A variation on this theme is possible. Take a hydrogen
iodide (HI) cell, and heat the HI to 2000&deg;K. Some of the HI
molecules will collide at high velocities and dissociate into
hydrogen and iodine: 2HI = H&#8322; + I&#8322;; the higher the temperature,
the more the dissociation. By separating the hydrogen
and iodine gases and returning them for recycling to the
fuel cell where they are recombined, we have eliminated
the fuel supply problem and created a <i>regenerative</i> fuel
cell. We have, however, also reintroduced the heat engine
and the Carnot cycle efficiency. The thermally regenerative
fuel cell is a true heat engine using a dissociating gas as
the working fluid.</p>
<h3>Scheme for Project Apollo</h3>
<p>Most of the impetus for developing the fuel cell as a practical
device comes from the space program. The cell has
admirable properties for space missions that are less than
a few months in duration. It is a clean, quiet, vibrationless
source of energy. Like the battery it has a high electrical
overload capacity for supplying power peaks and is easily
controlled. It can even provide potable water for a crew if
the Bacon H - O cell is used. For short missions where
large fuel supplies are not needed, it is also among the
lightest power plants available.</p>
<p>These compelling advantages have led the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration to choose the fuel cell for
some of the first manned space ventures. Project Apollo,
the manned lunar landing mission, is the most notable example.
Here the fuel cell will be not only an energy source,
but also part of the ecological cycle which keeps the crew
alive.</p>
<h4>Problem <span class="larger">4</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A manned space vehicle requires an average of 2
electrical kilowatts. A nuclear reactor thermoelectric
plant having a mass of 1000 kilograms,
including shielding, can supply this power for
10,000 hours. The basic fuel cell has a mass of 50
kilograms and consumes &frac12; kilogram of chemicals
per hour. The chemical containers weigh 25 kilograms.
What is the longest mission where the
total weight of the fuel cell will be less than the
weight of the nuclear power plant?</p>

<h3>Photons as Energy Carriers</h3>
<p>All our fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, owe their existence
to the solar energy stream that has engulfed the earth
for billions of years. The power in this stream amounts to
about 1400 watts per square meter at the earth, nearly
enough to supply an average home if all the energy were
converted to electricity. The problem is to get the sun&rsquo;s
rays to yield up their energy with high efficiency.</p>
<p>The sun&rsquo;s visible surface has a temperature around
6000&deg;K. Any object heated to this temperature will radiate
visible light mostly in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum
(5500 A<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>). Our energy conversion device should be
tuned to this wavelength.</p>
<p>The energy packets arriving from the sun are called
photons. They travel, of course, at the speed of light, and
each carries an amount of energy given by</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">E = hf = hc/&lambda;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">where</p>
<p class="t">E = energy (in joules)</p>
<p class="t">h = Planck&rsquo;s constant (6.62 &times; 10&#8315;&sup3;&#8308; joule-second)</p>
<p class="t">f = the light&rsquo;s frequency (in cycles per second = c/&lambda;)</p>
<p class="t">c = the velocity of light (300,000,000 meters per second)</p>
<p class="t">&lambda; = the wavelength (in meters)</p>
</div>
<p>Using the fact that an angstrom unit is 10&#8315;&sup1;&#8304; meter, the energy
of a 5500 A photon could be calculated as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc">E = hf = hc/&lambda; = (6.62 &times; 10&#8315;&sup3;&#8308; &times; 3.00 &times; 10&#8312;)/(5.50 &times; 10&#8315;&#8311;)</p>
<p class="lc">= 3.61 &times; 10&#8315;&sup1;&#8313; joule = 2.2 electron volts</p>
</div>
<p>Comparing this result, 2.2 electron volts, with the energies
required to cause atomic ionization or molecular dissociation
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
(an electron volt or so), we see that it is in the
right range to actuate direct conversion devices based on
such phenomena.</p>
<h3>Harnessing the Sun&rsquo;s Energy</h3>
<p>Historically, the sun&rsquo;s energy has most often been used
by concentrating it with a lens or mirror and then converting
it to heat. We could do this and run a heat engine, but a
more direct avenue is open.</p>
<p>About a decade ago it was found that the junction between
<i>p</i> and <i>n</i> semiconductors would generate electricity if illuminated.
This discovery led to the development of the <i>solar
cell</i>, a thin, lopsided sandwich of silicon semiconductors.
As shown in <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>, the top semiconductor layer exposed
to the sun is extremely thin, only 2.5 microns. Solar photons
can readily penetrate this layer and reach the junction
separating it from the thick main body of the solar cell.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 12 THE SOLAR CELL</b>
<br /><i>The photograph shows the solar cell in use
on a satellite. The spherical, radioisotope, thermoelectric
generator at the bottom of the satellite is used to supplement
the solar cells. In the solar cell, hole-electron pairs
are created by solar photons in the vicinity of a p-n junction.</i>

<dt>ELECTRONS</dt>
<dt>ENERGY OUT</dt></dl>
<p>Whenever <i>p-</i> and <i>n-</i>type semiconductors are sandwiched
together a voltage difference is created across the junction.
The separated holes and electrons in the two semiconductor
regions establish this electric field across the junction.
Unfortunately, there are usually no current carriers in the
immediate vicinity of the junction so that no power is produced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The absorption of solar photons in the vicinity of the junction
will create current carriers, as the photons&rsquo; energy is
transformed into the potential energy of the hole-electron
pairs. These pairs would quickly recombine and give up
their newly acquired potential energy if the electric field
existing across the junction did not whisk them away to an
external load.</p>
<p>The solar cell produces electricity when hole-electron
pairs are formed. Any other phenomenon that creates such
pairs will also generate electricity. The source of energy
is irrelevant so long as the current carriers are formed
near the junction. Thus, particles emitted by radioactive
atoms can also produce electricity from solar cells, although
too much bombardment by such particles can damage
the cell&rsquo;s atomic structure and reduce its output.</p>
<p>The solar cell is not a heat engine. Yet it loses enough
energy so that the sun&rsquo;s energy is converted at less than
15% efficiency. Losses commonly occur because of the recombination
of the hole-electron pairs before they can produce
current, the absorption of photons too far from the
junction, and the reflection of incident photons from the top
surface of the cell. Despite these losses solar cells are
now the mainstay of nonpropulsive space power.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">NUCLEAR BATTERIES</span></h2>
<h3>Energy from Nuclear Particles</h3>
<p>As we have seen, solar cells are able to convert the kinetic
energy of charged nuclear particles directly into electricity,
but a simpler and more straightforward way of doing
this exists. This involves direct use of the flow of charged
particles as current.</p>
<p>The <i>nuclear battery</i> shown in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a> performs this
trick. A central rod is coated with an electron-emitting radioisotope
(a beta-emitter; say, strontium-90). The high-velocity
electrons emitted by the radioisotope cross the gap
between the cylinders and are collected by a simple metallic
sleeve and sent to the load. Simple, but why don&rsquo;t space
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
charge effects prevent the electrons
from crossing the gap as they do in
the thermionic converter? The answer
lies in the fact that the nuclear electrons
have a million times more kinetic
energy than those boiled off the
thermionic converter&rsquo;s emitter surface.
Consequently, they are too powerful
to be stopped by any space charge
in the narrow gap.</p>
<p>Nuclear batteries are simple and
rugged. They generate only microamperes
of current at 10,000 to 100,000
volts.</p>

<h3>Double Conversion</h3>
<p>In the earlier description of the energy conversion matrix,
we saw that we could go through the energy transformation
process repeatedly until we obtained the kind of energy
we wanted. This is exemplified in a type of nuclear
battery which uses the so-called <i>double conversion</i> approach.
First, the high-velocity nuclear particles are absorbed
in a phosphor which emits visible light. The photons
thus produced are then absorbed in a group of strategically
placed solar cells, which deliver electrical power to the
load. Although efficiency is lost at each energy transformation,
the double conversion technique still ends up with an
overall efficiency of from 1 to 5%, an acceptable value for
power supplies in the watt and milliwatt ranges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">ADVANCED CONCEPTS</span></h2>
<p>Ferroelectric and thermomagnetic conversion are subtle
concepts which depend upon the gross alteration of a material&rsquo;s
physical properties by the application of heat. Devices
employing such concepts are true heat engines. Instead
of the gaseous and electronic working fluids used in
the other direct conversion concepts, the ferroelectric and
thermomagnetic concepts employ patterns of atoms and
molecules that are actually rearranged periodically by heat.</p>
<h3>Ferroelectric Conversion</h3>
<p>Ferroelectric conversion makes use of the peculiar properties
of <i>dielectric</i><a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> materials. Barium titanate, for example,
has good dielectric properties at low temperatures,
but, when its temperature is raised to more than 120&deg;C,
the properties get worse rapidly. We cannot discuss dielectric
behavior thoroughly in this booklet; suffice it to say that
in this process heat is absorbed in a realignment of molecules
within the barium titanate latticework.</p>
<p>If we now place a slab of barium titanate between the two
plates of an electrical condenser and charge the condenser,
as shown in <a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a>, we have a unique way of converting
heat into electricity directly. When the barium titanate is
heated above its <i>Curie point</i><a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> of 120&deg;C, the condenser&rsquo;s
capacitance is radically reduced as the dielectric constant
falls. The condenser is forced to discharge and move electrons
through an external circuit consisting of the load and
the original source of charge. Useful electrical energy is
delivered during this step. <a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a> shows the process
schematically and mathematically. When the dielectric is
cooled, waste heat is given up by the barium titanate, and
the cycle is complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 14 FERROELECTRIC ENERGY CONVERSION</b>

<h3>Thermomagnetic Conversion</h3>
<p>The <i>analog</i><a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> of ferroelectricity is ferromagnetism. A
converter employing similar principles to those in ferroelectricity
can be made using an electrical <i>inductance</i> with
a ferromagnetic core. When the temperature of the ferromagnetic
material is raised above its Curie point, its magnetic
<i>permeability</i> drops quickly, causing the magnetic field
to collapse partially. Energy may be delivered to an external
load during this change. Instead of energy being stored
in an electrostatic field, it is stored in a magnetic field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Ferroelectric and thermomagnetic conversion both represent
a class of energy transformations which involve internal
molecular or crystalline rearrangements of solids.
There is no change of phase as in a steam engine, but the
energy changes are there nevertheless. In thermodynamics
such internal geometrical changes are called <i>second-order</i>
transitions, as opposed to the <i>first-order</i> transitions observed
with heat engines using two-phase working fluids
like water/steam.</p>
<h3>On the Frontier</h3>
<p>Other potential energy conversion schemes are being investigated
by scientists and engineers. Those listed in the
Energy Conversion Matrix (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) only scratch the
surface.</p>
<p>In particular, we are just learning how to manipulate
photons. There are photochemical, photoelectric, and even
photomechanical transformations. These have hardly been
tapped.</p>
<p>Consider the reaction when an electron and its antimatter
equivalent, the positron, meet. They mutually annihilate
each other in a burst of energy! This energy will be harnessed
someday.</p>
<p>What energy conversion device are we going to use to
completely convert mass into energy? The energy requirements
for interstellar exploration are so great that these
voyages will be impossible unless a new device is found
that can completely transform mass into energy.</p>
<p>Then again, we haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea of how to control
gravitational energy, but we may learn.</p>
<p>The panorama is endless.</p>
<h4>Problem <span class="larger">5</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A 1,000,000-kilogram spaceship takes off for Alpha
Centauri, our nearest star, 4.3 light years away.
If it accelerates to nine-tenths the velocity of light,
what is its kinetic energy? How much fuel mass
will have to be completely converted to energy to
acquire this velocity?</p>

<p>First, mechanical energy drives the car&rsquo;s electric

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>From the kinetic energy equation we get</p>
<p class="center">v = &#8730;(2 E/m)</p>
<p>Since the engine is 25% efficient, the energy available
to propel the car is 48,000 &times; 0.25 or 12,000

<p class="center">v = &#8730;(24,000/1,000) = 2&#8730;6 = 4.9 meters per second</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p class="center">e = (300 - 20)/300 = 14/15 = 0.93 = 93%</p>
<p>The crossover point, t, in hours is found by equating
the nuclear power plant mass and that of the

<p>The ship will use the same amount of energy to
decelerate at its destination. Note that this calculation

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
